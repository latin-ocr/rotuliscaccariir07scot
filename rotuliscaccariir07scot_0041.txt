in aid of Henry VL, whom the battle of Northamp-
ton (lOth J uly 1460) had delivered into the hands
of his enemies. Meantime the English Queen
Margaret of Anjou, with her son, had escaped to
Wales, and came from Wales to Scotland2 in J anuary
following, when they were received and entertained
by the widow of James Π. at Lincluden Abbey.
This visit lasted ten or twelve days‚3 during which
three pipes of white wine of Poitou were drunk,
and three bolls of salt (grossi salis) consumed.4 In
the schemes discussed between the two queens for
the ‹zo-operation of the Scots with the cause of
Henry, the restoration of Berwick was doubtless
made a condition, as it had been before James'
death; and it is said that a project was also dis-
cussed for a marriage between Prince Edward and
the‘3Princess Mary of Scotland.5

On returning to England, Margaret quickly
assembled an army. The temporary triumph of
her party at Wakefield, the slaughter of the Duke
of York and his son Richard, and the reverses
sustained by the Lancastrians at Mortimer's Cross‚
