PREFACE. lxiii

premised that, valuable as these records are for
genealogical as well as other purposes, a certain
allowance must always be made for the possibility
of verbal slips on the part of the engrossing clerk.
A clerical error in the present volume regarding
the year in which Mary of Gueldres died has
been aheady adverted to. Wide as was the lati-
tude of orthography allowed in proper names,
spelh'ngs are found from time to time which can
only be accounted for by the limited local
knowledge of the writer of the roll. A wrong Α
Christian name occasionally occurs; and such a
mistake, when it has once been made, has a tend-
ency to recur, the clerk having before him, and
being to a large extent guided by, the cor-
responding account of the preceding year. We
have, for example, found Isabel Countess of Mar
called Euphemia in 1456 ;1 and in a passage
in the present volume J ames Dunbar Earl of
Moray is called Thomas? a mistake which at
one time led Mr Riddell to suppose that the wives
of the second Lord Crichton and of Archibald
Douglas were not sisters but cousins.3

In the discharge side of the account of the lordship
of Brechin for 1465,4 we find the rents of Pettin-
toscale‚ Petpullokis, and Tilquhffly, amounting to
3233, 83. Sd„ paid, in virtue of a grant to continue
