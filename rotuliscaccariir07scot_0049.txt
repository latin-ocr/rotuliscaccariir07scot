of Seotland, to be effected by the combined forces
of the island Lord and the Earl of Douglas‚ and
for a partition of the conquered realm between the
two Earls and Donald Balloch, who were to
acknowledge themselves vassals of England, bound
to assist Edward in his Wars.¹

The rebellion thus planned broke out almost
before the date of this treaty, headed by a natural
son of the Earl of Ross, and the same Donald
Balloch whose depredatione had caused trouble to
the Crown in the preceding reign. The island
Lord, still in the style of a sovereigm issued pro-
clamations to the inhabitants of the sheriffdoms
and burghs of Inverness and Nairn, enj oining them
to obey his son Angus as his lieutenant, directing
that the Orown rents and customs should be paid
to himself, and authorising punishment to be
inflicted on the refractory. In the proceedings
taken against him twelve years later he is said to
have further laid siege to Rothesay (lasne, and
plundered the islands of Bute and Arran, putting
to death many of the inhabitants,2 acts generally
assumed to have been committed at this time, but
of which we find no trace in the contemporary
Exehequer accounts, including those of Bute.3
