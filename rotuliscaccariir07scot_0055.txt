to be included in the Queen’s joint infeftment,¹
although unmentioned in the recorded charter.
Computing from the data furnished by the
Exchequer accounts, the Queen's income froni
these sources would quite amount to the 385000
secured to her.

Building operations figure largely in the credit
sicle of the Queen's accounts. Repairs and altera-
tions were going on at Stirling Castle,² and still
more at Falkland, in connection with which there
are various details about a new chamber constructed
for the Queen, with glass windows, and an ambry
(armoriole). Friar Andrew Lisouris‚ a lay brother
of Cupar-Fife, who as King's carpenter is pro-
minent in the accounts of this and the preceding
reign, was, with other members of the same craft,
at work for eighty days fitting up this apartment.
Andirons are provided for it, a “viridarium ’' or
lawn is laid out in front of it, and a door is made
to communicate between the chamber and the lawn.
There were also repairs going on in the eastern
part of the palace called“le counthouse.” The
great hall got a new fireplace; a lock for the
wardrobe, and a key for the great chamber door
occur among the other items 3 and there was a new
stable costing 0216, 2s. 7d., and a new coalhouse.3
