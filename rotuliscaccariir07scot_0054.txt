the Privy Sea] continued in his custody until 1468,
shortly before his death, when he was made
Treasurer. The author of the Asloan MS. speaks
unfavourably of 111111,1 but his estimate of his
character must be received cum nota, in con-
sideration of the pronounced sympathies of that
chronicler with the old Lords.l The name of
another churchman and confidentia] servant of
the Queen Dowager, Henry Kinghorn, Steward of
her household, is of frequent occurrence. After the
separation of the King's and Queen's households,
there was an officer called the Queen⁷s “placitor'’
or legal adviser‚2 and Master Gilbert Hering is on
one occasion designed “ advocatus domine regine.”3

We have in 1461 and 1462 separately audited
rous of the “ballivi'’ of the Queen's lands, these
including exactly those conveyed in 1451, namely,
the Crown property adjoining Linlithgow and
Stirh'ng, Menteith, Methvcn, Strathern, Kinclevin‚
Fife, March, Mar, Garioch, and Brechin. The
accounts show that, in accordanee with that grant
of 1451, she also received an annuity of „4:100 from
the customs of Aberdeen, the “officium vicecomitis”
(that is the Crown revenue from) the sheriffdom
of Linlithgoxv, and the fermes and customs of
the burghs of Perth, Stirling, Linlithgow, Inver-
keithjng, Kinghorn, and Cupar, to which 111 the
