Boece has a story, which has been repeated on his
authority by later writers, of an attack on the
Cast-le of Blair, and the dragging ‘che Earl of Athole
(uncle of the King)‚ and his Countess the quondam

act of sacrilege followed by such unequivocal
manifestations of Divine vengeance on land and
sea, that the rebels were at last sain to restore the
Earl and Countess, and perform penance with the
deepest humih'ty at the shrine Which they had
violated. We have discovered no corroboration of
these incidents in the Exchequer rolls, any more

There is no trace of any active participation of
the Earl of Douglas in it3 nor did the Scottish
Government, until a later period, obtain full
knowledge of Ross’s treasonable dealings with
Edward IV. According to the Asloan Chronicle,
tho Lord of the Isles was summoned to Parliament
“under the pane of forfalt and comperit nocht.
And than thai supersedit⁴ his caus quhill⁷³ (till)
“ the feist of Sanct Jhon the Baptist, and continewit
the forsaid Parliament till that day to be haldin at
Aberdene.''¹ Neither of this Parliament, nor of its
adjourned meeting at Aberdeen on St John the
Baptist's Day 1463, have any records been pre-
