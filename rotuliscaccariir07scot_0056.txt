1 PREFACE.

But the most extensive works carried on by the
Queen, to which a large share of her income was
devoted, were connected with the Castle of Ravens-
craig, and the collegiate church of Trinity near
Edinburgh.

It was probably James Π. who conceived the
design of placing a royal Castle on the cliff that
protrudes into the Firth of F orth near Dysart. On
Sth March 1459—60, five months before that King's
death, the lancls of Dysart, specified as KVilstoune,
Oarbarry, and Dubbo, and of which this rocky
promontory formed part, were resigned in the
Queen⁷s favour by Walter Ramsay and Janet his
wife, who held them as vassals of the earldorn
of Fffe, they getting in exchange Crounerland,
Manuelrig (the colliery excepted), and Gilleis-
land near Linlithgow.1 The building operations‚
begun at the very commencement of Mary’s widow-
hood, were carried on with great vigour under the
direction of Master David Boys, as master of works.
In the accounts of the Queen's lands and fermes for
1462 and 1463, Boys receives for this building
sums amounting together to 11:600? Other entries
tell us of the bringing, in the year 1461, of fourteen
great timber-s called “ joists ” from the woods on the

the Linlithgow accounts of 1466,
1468, and 1469, Crounareland is said
to have been granted to Archibald Ι
Ramsay (the successor of Walter), 111
exchango for Ravenseraig (pages
404, 536, 629). The same family of
Ramsays are afterwards designed

from the lands of Dunnone in Forfar-
shire owned by them. —Reg Mag. sig.

14 June 1434, and 16 Nov. 1507).

of these sums are received by Boys’s
assistant, a chaplain named Spanky.
